# dotfiles
my personal dotfiles. managed with [yadm](https://github.com/TheLocehiliosan/yadm)
if you want to learn more about dotfiles and create your own, [dotfiles on github](https://dotfiles.github.io/) is a good start

these dots are for my main pc ('avoid'), and my thinkpad t460s ('thinkpad'). both currently running Sway on Void Linux.
